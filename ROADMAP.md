[Readme](README.md) |
[Charts](charts.md) 
## Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive schematic interface that provides detailed information about miner components in a user-friendly manner.

## Phase 1: Planning and Documentation
### Tasks:
- **Initial Meeting (Completed on January 15th)**: Discuss overall project goals, scope, and potential challenges.
  - **Participants**: James, Juergen, Scott
  - **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Requirement Gathering**: Identify key software components and architecture to be included in the MVP.
  - **Participants**: James
  - **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## Phase 2: Schematic Design
### Tasks:
- **Minimal Schematic Creation**: Juergen to develop a basic schematic for web use.
  - **Participants**: Juergen
  - **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Schematic Review and Feedback**: James to provide feedback and suggestions.
  - **Participants**: James, Juergen
  - **Estimated Time**: 1 hour

## Phase 3: Content Development
### Tasks:
- **Component Documentation**: James to work with Juergen to document each main component, and gather all relevant metadata including the coordinates as they exist on the diagram.
  - **Participants**: James, Juergen
  - **Estimated Time**: 5-10 hours (flexible based on component count)

## Phase 4: Web Interface Development
### Tasks:
- **Prototype Development**: Create a basic web interface for the schematic.
  - **Participants**: James (or designated web developer)
  - **Estimated Time**: 5-10 hours (based on number of components and metadata complexity)
- **Interface Testing and Iteration**: Test the interface for usability and make necessary improvements.
  - **Participants**: James, Juergen, Scott
  - **Estimated Time**: 5-10 hours

## Phase 5: Additional Setup (If Necessary)
### Tasks:
- **Development Environment Setup**: Establish a suitable development environment.
  - **Participants**: James
  - **Estimated Time**: 2 hours (If required)
- **Production Provisioning**: Prepare the production environment.
  - **Participants**: James
  - **Estimated Time**: 1 hour (If required)
- **JIRA and Git Hosting Setup**: Set up project management and version control systems.
  - **Participants**: James
  - **Estimated Time**: 1.5 hours (If required)

## Phase 6: Analytics Integration
### Tasks:
- **Analytics Setup**: Implement tracking and analytics tools.
  - **Participants**: James
  - **Estimated Time**: 2 hours

## Phase 7: Intellectual Property Protection and Server-Side Implementation
### Tasks:
- **Securing Software Assets**: Focus on server-side coding and embedding critical functionalities within the app to prevent unauthorized cloning.
  - **Approach**: Explore and implement security measures such as server-side processing and code obfuscation.
  - **Timing**: Scheduled post-core development to allow for focused R&D and solution exploration.
  - **Participants**: James (and possibly external security experts)
  - **Estimated Time**: To be determined after core development and R&D.

## Phase 8: Final Review and Launch
### Tasks:
- **Final Review and Testing**: Ensure everything is working seamlessly and efficiently.
  - **Participants**: James, Juergen, Scott
  - **Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
- **Launch**: Make the interface live and monitor initial user interactions.
  - **Participants**: James, Juergen, Scott
  - **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## Ongoing: Maintenance and Updates
### Tasks:
- **Regular Updates and Maintenance**: Address any issues, update content, and improve features based on user feedback.
  - **Participants**: James, Juergen
  - **Estimated Time**: Ongoing, as needed

## Notes:
- The time estimates are flexible and can be adjusted as the project progresses.
- Regular meetings should be scheduled to ensure everyone is on the same page and to discuss any changes or updates to the project plan.
